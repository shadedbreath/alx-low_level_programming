1. **Task 0 - Print Program Name**:
   - Create a program that prints its own name.
   - Even if you rename the program, it should still print the new name.
   - It should also include the path before the program name.

2. **Task 1 - Count Arguments**:
   - Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
   - The program should print the count of arguments followed by a new line.

3. **Task 2 - Print All Arguments**:
   - Create a program that prints all the arguments it receives.
   - Include the first argument.
   - Print each argument on a separate line followed by a new line.

4. **Task 3 - Multiply Two Numbers**:
   - Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
   - Print the result followed by a new line.
   - If the program doesn't receive two arguments, print "Error" and return 1.

5. **Task 4 - Add Positive Numbers**:
   - Create a program that adds positive numbers.
   - Print the result followed by a new line.
   - If no numbers are passed, print "0".
   - If any argument contains non-digit symbols, print "Error" and return 1.

6. **Task 5 - Minimum Coins for Change**:
   - Write a program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for an amount of money in cents.
   - Usage: `./change cents` where `cents` is the amount in cents.
   - If not exactly one argument is given, print "Error" and return 1.
   - If the argument is negative, print "0".
   - You can use coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent.

These tasks are essentially about creating programs that perform specific actions based on the command-line arguments they receive when you run them.
